(Malay elementary school registration node.js project)
my first ever node.js project/prototype(75% completion need further update for template pages .ejs) for elementary school registration with mongodb.

basically its a system for kids registration through parent account. parent will also be able to update and see the details of their childrens on which classes, make purchases for yearly/monthly registration bill, clothes, and books.

for teachers, they will be able to see the details of students of their own classes and update students attendance records.

admins can do everything teachers can do except they will have the access to all classes.

at the moment we have teacher, parent and admin account access only.

How to use:
Let me remind you it is incomplete and about 75% completion only.

in the app.js i have emptied out the url for the mongodb so make sure to use your own mongodb url.

for client-side testing purposes you may use my url on the line 211 of app.py:
mongodb+srv://hfzdnedu:KQkRnx4dehRxqZ40@itary.uitcp.mongodb.net/detail

line 151 and 152(copy paste to both line):
mongodb+srv://hfzdnedu:KQkRnx4dehRxqZ40@itary.uitcp.mongodb.net/session
